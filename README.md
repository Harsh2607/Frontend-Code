### Day 1 Topics

1. **Network**: A connection between two or more systems, allowing them to send and receive data from each other.
_e.g. A home WiFi network, a company's intranet, the internet_

2. **Web**: A collection of linked documents, accessed via the internet, allowing users to view and interact with web pages using a web browser. (e.g. Google, Facebook, Wikipedia)

3. **Internet**: A global network of networks, connecting millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, using the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks. (e.g. The internet is like a huge network of connected computers)

4. **Web Client**: A software application, typically a web browser, that requests and displays web content from web servers. (e.g. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox)

5. **Web Server**: A computer system hosting websites and serving web pages to clients upon request, processing incoming network requests over HTTP and related protocols. (e.g. Apache, Nginx)

6. **DNS (Domain Name System)**: A hierarchical system translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses, acting like the phonebook of the internet. (e.g. When you type "google.com" in your browser, DNS translates it to the IP address 216.58.194.174)

7. **Frontend**: The user interface and user experience of a website or web application, including everything users see and interact with directly in their web browsers, using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. (e.g. The layout of a website, the buttons and forms, the animations, the interactive elements)
